Project Title: QR Code Generator and Scanner

Technologies Used: Node.js, Express.js,  QR Code Libraries (e.g., qrcode for generation, node-qrcode for scanning)

Project Overview:
The QR Code Generator and Scanner project focuses on developing a robust backend system to create and interpret QR codes. Leveraging the power of Node.js and Express.js, this project serves as a comprehensive solution for businesses and applications that require QR code functionalities for operations such as product tracking, user authentication, or digital payments.

Project Details:

Node.js and Express.js: The backend is built using Node.js, a powerful JavaScript runtime, and Express.js, a flexible web application framework. Together, they provide a scalable and efficient server-side environment for handling requests, processing data, and managing QR code operations.

QR Code Libraries: Specialized libraries like qrcode and node-qrcode are utilized to generate and decode QR codes. These libraries simplify the process of creating visually appealing QR codes and interpreting their encoded information.
Key Features:

QR Code Generation: Users can generate QR codes for various types of data, such as URLs, text, or contact information. The backend processes the input and returns a QR code image or link that can be used immediately or stored for future use.
QR Code Scanning and Decoding: The system supports decoding of scanned QR codes, extracting and processing the embedded information. This feature is essential for applications that need to interpret QR codes for actions like logging in users, accessing content, or validating transactions.
Data Management: The backend securely stores generated and scanned QR codes along with their metadata in MongoDB. This includes tracking the creation time, usage history, and the type of data encoded.
API Services: The project provides RESTful APIs for generating and scanning QR codes, making it easy to integrate with front-end applications or other services. These APIs facilitate seamless communication between different components of the system.
Learning Outcomes:

Backend Development: This project has deepened my understanding of building scalable and efficient backend systems using Node.js and Express.js.

QR Code Technology: I have gained practical experience in using QR code libraries for both generation and decoding, crucial for developing modern web applications that require QR functionalities.
